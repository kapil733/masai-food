The Zomato dataset provides a unique opportunity to gain valuable insights into Bengaluru's vibrant restaurant scene. With over 12,000 restaurants serving diverse cuisines worldwide, Bengaluru is a dynamic culinary hub. This analysis aims to shed light on the factors influencing restaurant establishment and success, as well as the preferences of the city's residents.
Bengaluru, known as the IT capital of India, witnesses a continuous influx of new restaurants to meet the growing demand for convenient dining options.
Many people here rely on restaurant food due to time constraints.
Despite the increasing demand, newcomers often struggle to compete with established eateries, often offering similar menus.
Given the overwhelming demand for restaurants, it becomes crucial to examine the demographic characteristics of different localities.

(1) Location of the restaurant
(2) Approximate price of food
(3) Theme-based restaurant categorization
